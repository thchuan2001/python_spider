These indicators take policies such as school closures, travel bans, etc. and record them on an ordinal scale; the remainder are financial indicators such as fiscal or monetary measures.<br><br>OxCGRT measures the variation in governments’ responses using its 'COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index (Stringency Index)'. This composite measure is a simple additive score of nine indicators measured on an ordinal scale, 
  rescaled to vary from 0 to 100. Please note that this measure is for comparative purposes only, and should not necessarily be interpreted as a rating of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country's response.<br><br>It also includes a measure of 'COVID - 19 Containment and 
  Health Response' index which is based on the metrics used in the 'Stringency Index' plus testing policy, contact tracing, face coverings and vaccine policy.<br><br>Note: <br>This is an ongoing collation project of live data. If you see any inaccuracies in the underlying data please contact us on the feedback form below. The underlying index is evolving as the situation and data evolves from country to country, and will change over time as the data gets more accurate.<br><br>The specific policy and response categories are coded as follows:<br><br>School closures:<br>0 - No measures<br>1 - recommend closing<br>2 - Require closing (only some levels or categories,<br>eg just high school, or just public schools)<br>3 - Require closing all levels<br>No data - blank<br><br>Workplace closures:<br>0 - No measures<br>1 - recommend closing (or work from home)<br>2 - require closing (or work from home) for some<br>sectors or categories of workers<br>3 - require closing (or work from home) all but essential workplaces (eg grocery stores, doctors)<br>No data - blank<br><br>Cancel public events:<br>0- No measures<br>1 - Recommend cancelling<br>2 - Require cancelling<br>No data - blank<br><br>Restrictions on gatherings:<br>0 - No restrictions<br>1 - Restrictions on very large gatherings (the limit is above 1000 people)<br>2 - Restrictions on gatherings between 100-1000 people<br>3 -
